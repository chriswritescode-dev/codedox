### üöÄ Major Features & Improvements

**Unified Code Extraction System**
- Complete refactor to a unified extraction architecture with factory pattern
- New `ExtractedCodeBlock` model with semantic `ExtractedContext` for better code understanding
- Consolidated HTML, Markdown, and RST extraction into specialized extractors with shared base class
- Improved extraction rules: multi-line blocks always extracted, single-line with 3+ significant words
- Better handling of unclosed markdown fence blocks and HTML button elements

**Source-Scoped Duplicate Detection**
- **Breaking Change**: Duplicate detection now scoped to individual sources instead of global
- Same code snippets can exist across different documentation sources
- New composite unique constraint (document_id, code_hash) replaces global code_hash constraint
- Automatic database migration system with migration 008_remove_code_hash_unique
- Shared utility function `find_duplicate_snippet_in_source()` for consistent duplicate checking

**Enhanced Frontend Experience**
- Refactored DocumentDetail page with custom `useDocumentDetail` hook
- Improved search UX with better focus management and search result counts
- Enhanced language filtering with count display in dropdown

### üîß Technical Improvements

**Extraction Engine**
- Removed legacy SimpleCodeBlock and html_code_extractor.py systems
- Factory pattern for creating format-specific extractors
- Better context-aware HTML extraction with heading detection
- Improved title extraction combining section headings with page titles
- Enhanced RST support with better literal block detection

**Database & Migrations**
- Automatic migration application on app startup
- New migration check system that applies pending migrations automatically
- Updated SQLAlchemy models for new constraint structure

**Code Quality**
- Removed redundant wrapper functions and adapter layers
- Cleaned up 34 files with 2,805 additions and 1,921 deletions in main refactor
- Migrated all 269+ tests to new extraction API
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new extraction system

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed UploadProcessor missing heartbeat tracking methods
- Removed pygame-specific corruption handling from RST extractor
- Fixed retry failed pages to maintain original source association

### üìù Developer Experience

- Better extraction rules with semantic understanding
- Improved error handling and edge case coverage
- Enhanced test suite with dedicated extractor tests

### üîÑ Migration Notes

**Automatic Migrations**: The database schema will be automatically updated when starting the application. The migration adds source-scoped duplicate detection.

**Breaking Changes**: 
- Code extraction now uses `ExtractedCodeBlock` model instead of dictionary-based approach
- Duplicate detection API changed from global to source-scoped
- Removed `container_type` field from extraction models
